ELM327_Terminal
===============

A short Arduino sketch to allow testing of OBDII scanners set up for UART communication using the Arduino Serial Monitor. It requires an Arduino with at least two serial ports (example: Arduino MEGA).

This Arduino example was developed in order to test an OBDII to UART device purchased from the internet. It allows the user to quickly determine whether or not the OBDII device is functional. 

For detailed notes on the ELM327 and its implementation see the ELM327 data sheet.
